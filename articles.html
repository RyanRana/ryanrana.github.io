        <p> Imagine a world where artificial intelligence becomes 40 times more efficient every year — not just better, but smarter, cheaper, and faster, all at once. Decisions that once took days now take seconds. Entire industries are rewritten. Economies surge. And jobs? Many vanish, while new ones emerge at lightning speed. This isn’t science fiction — it’s the logical conclusion of compounding technological growth. Just as Moore’s Law revolutionized hardware, AI is now riding its own exponential curve — one far steeper and more transformative. In this piece, we’ll break down the math behind AI’s insane efficiency gains, what it means for automation, GDP, and the very structure of society — and why the future may arrive faster than anyone expects. We’re entering an age where intelligence itself is becoming a scalable, cheap, and unstoppable force — and the choices we make now will define how it shapes our future.</p>

        <p> In the world of business, having a robust plan is essential for success. However, creating and analyzing a comprehensive business plan can be a daunting task. To address this challenge, I developed PLANA: Plan Learning, Analysis, and Advisory. This innovative tool is designed to assist entrepreneurs, business analysts, and investors by leveraging the power of multiple machining learning models to provide a thorough analysis of business plans. In this blog post, I’ll take you through the journey of creating PLANA, its features, and how it can transform the way business plans are evaluated.</p>

        <p> Wikipedia is by far the most accessible way to get knowledge about anything because each page hyperlinks to many other pages. They connect articles across various topics, enabling users to traverse from one page to another in just a few clicks. This phenomenon is exemplified by the popular “Wiki Game,” where players attempt to navigate between two seemingly unrelated pages using as few clicks as possible. But have you ever wondered if any two pages on Wikipedia can’t be connected? I set out to explore this idea.</p>

        <p> Developer productivity metrics must balance speed, quality, and innovation, as over-prioritization of one objective undermines the others, leading to inefficiencies and decreased long-term value. In the fast-paced world of software development, teams are constantly pressured to deliver more — faster, better, and more creatively. However, achieving excellence in speed, quality, and innovation simultaneously is akin to solving an unsolvable trilemma. Each of these objectives competes for limited resources and focus, making it challenging to achieve a harmonious balance. From this lets study this theories with only three metrics: Speed, Quality, and Innovation. I set out to explore the intricacies of this metrics trilemma, provides real-world examples of its consequences, and proposes a framework to address it systematically.</p>

        <p> I’ve been a developer for several years. Between freelancing, working at startups, and being an engineer for an established company, the most important thing I have to do to benefit me as a developer is work on personal programming projects.

It opened my mind up creatively and congenially in ways that never would have been possible in any other way.

I didn’t get into programming to analyze meaningless data for a Fortune 500. I got into programming to turn my ideas into reality and make the things I want to make. often we lose sight of that as we start taking jobs and climbing the corporate engineering ladder.</p>

        <p> Can we train software to think solely by observing behavior? This question lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Let’s consider an example: suppose we aim to develop AI software for constructing houses. Typically, houses are built by a team of human builders utilizing various tools. In order to build our software, we can observe the decisions made by humans and attempt to utilize imitation learning algorithms to map robot observations to the building decisions made by humans.</p>

        <p> In my sophomore year of high school, inspired by the pandemic’s challenges, friends and I revived our dormant Computer Science club by launching “Hills Hacks,” a student-organized hackathon.

We pretty much started from scratch with no direction or model to build off of and a group of underclassman highschoolers yields little no expiuerence either.

Over three years, we navigated hurdles, honed leadership skills, and fostered community engagement.</p>

The work done in this garage changed the way people use technology forever. Jobs and Wozniak started out building the Apple I; the first product released by Apple. Years later, The iPhone, was released becoming a household product and impacting almost every facet of our lives. It’s now one of the world’s biggest companies.

2021 at 2 Kraushe Rd, Warren, New Jersey: In a bedroom found at this address a 15-year-old high school student had an idea that allows students and teachers to share their schedules online and make group chats within their school community. The high school sophomore started building this product and marketed it to the students at his school called CourseTurtle. Several weeks passed and the local hype died and the company didn’t grow further.</p>

This is better than traditional methods because it does not interfere with pipes, it is cheap, it has an easy setup, the accuracy is near 100%, the algorithm can always be improved and changed, it has a possibility for future expansion, and the data is easily obtainable and expandable.

          Have you ever tried to take a picture of your math homework or a receipt and your iPhone scans the paper as a pdf instead of a regular image? Well, that is actually a really interesting application of Computer Vision and Python, which is the tool we will be building today. Due to the rising online workload, sending a digitalized version of a document by email or other means is becoming increasingly common. To put it another way, turn any paper into a scan-like presentation.

          When it comes to stocks, a backtester is an essential tool. Backtesting is a method of determining the practicality of a trading strategy by examining how it would perform using previous data. If you came up with a strategy, would you automatically trust it? No, you would want to test it, and historical data helps that. If backtesting proves to be effective, traders and analysts may be more willing to use it in the future. Essentially, backtesting takes historical data and applies it to current data to predict how stocks would perform. The main issue with backtesting is that it is a lot of work and takes a long to do manually, so that is why it would be smart to build one with Python. The strategy we will use is the moving averages strategy and implement that into our code.

          Linear algebra is extremely important in the topic of computer science and especially machine learning. Linear regression is a simple supervised machine learning model directly built off linear algebra. The goal of this article is not to give you a math lesson but instead walk you through the algebra that makes up a regression model and then how to build one in python.
