                            <p>Imagine a world where artificial intelligence becomes 40 times more efficient every year — not just better, but smarter, cheaper, and faster, all at once. Decisions that once took days now take seconds. Entire industries are rewritten. Economies surge. And jobs? Many vanish, while new ones emerge at lightning speed. This isn't science fiction — it's the logical conclusion of compounding technological growth. Just as Moore's Law revolutionized hardware, AI is now riding its own exponential curve — one far steeper and more transformative.</p>

                            <p>In the world of business, having a robust plan is essential for success. However, creating and analyzing a comprehensive business plan can be a daunting task. To address this challenge, I developed PLANA: Plan Learning, Analysis, and Advisory.

                            <p>Wikipedia is by far the most accessible way to get knowledge about anything because each page hyperlinks to many other pages. They connect articles across various topics, enabling users to traverse from one page to another in just a few clicks. This phenomenon is exemplified by the popular "Wiki Game," where players attempt to navigate between two seemingly unrelated pages using as few clicks as possible. But have you ever wondered if any two pages on Wikipedia can't be connected?</p>

It opened my mind up creatively and congenially in ways that never would have been possible in any other way. I didn't get into programming to analyze meaningless data for a Fortune 500. I got into programming to turn my ideas into reality and make the things I want to make.</p>

                            <p>Can we train software to think solely by observing behavior? This question lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Let's consider an example: suppose we aim to develop AI software for constructing houses. Typically, houses are built by a team of human builders utilizing various tools. In order to build our software, we can observe the decisions made by humans and attempt to utilize imitation learning algorithms to map robot observations to the building decisions made by humans.</p>

This research paper proposes the development of a wearable haptic device, Helios, aimed at assisting visually impaired individuals in sensing, recognizing, and securing different objects in their environment. By leveraging natural language processing and computer vision techniques, Helios aims to create a closed circuit system situated on the user's wrist.</p>

Backtesting is a method of determining the practicality of a trading strategy by examining how it would perform using previous data. If you came up with a strategy, would you automatically trust it? No, you would want to test it, and historical data helps that. The main issue with backtesting is that it is a lot of work and takes a long to do manually, so that is why it would be smart to build one with Python.</p>

                            <p>Linear algebra is extremely important in the topic of computer science and especially machine learning. Linear regression is a simple supervised machine learning model directly built off linear algebra. The goal of this article is not to give you a math lesson but instead walk you through the algebra that makes up a regression model and then how to build one in python.</p>
